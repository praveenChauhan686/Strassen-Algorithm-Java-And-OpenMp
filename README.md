# Strassen-Algorithm-Java-And-OpenMp
To tackle this problem, the first solution uses the Strassen algorithm in OpenMP
whereas the second solution/approach for Matrix Multiplication leverages the Multiple Threading notion using Strassen algorithm in Java.
â€¢ Following the successful execution of both solutions, I compared the execution time for both OpenMp and Java on multiple threads, i.e., 1-8 threads working on 
500x500, 700x700,900x900 and 1000x1000 dimensioned matrices respectively using table and graphs, further in the report.
